    "### Explanation of the Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Array Initialization**: \n",
    "   - The underlying array `self.stack` is initialized with a size of `N`. Initially, the red stack's top pointer is `-1` (indicating it's empty), and the blue stack's top pointer is set to `N` (indicating it starts from the end of the array).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Red Push and Blue Push**: \n",
    "   - `red_push(item)` adds an element to the red stack by incrementing `red_top` and placing the item at that position.\n",
    "   - `blue_push(item)` adds an element to the blue stack by decrementing `blue_top` and placing the item there.\n",
    "   - Both operations check whether there is space left in the array for the item. If the red stack grows into the space of the blue stack (or vice versa), an `IndexError` is raised.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Red Pop and Blue Pop**: \n",
    "   - `red_pop()` removes and returns the top element from the red stack by accessing `red_top` and then decrementing the pointer.\n",
    "   - `blue_pop()` removes and returns the top element from the blue stack by accessing `blue_top` and then incrementing the pointer.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Peek Operations**: \n",
    "   - `red_peek()` and `blue_peek()` return the top elements of the respective stacks without removing them.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Empty Checks**: \n",
    "   - `is_red_empty()` and `is_blue_empty()` check if the respective stacks are empty by comparing the stack pointers to their initial values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Size Operations**: \n",
    "   - `red_size()` and `blue_size()` return the number of elements in the respective stacks. The size of the red stack is `red_top + 1`, and the size of the blue stack is the difference between the total capacity and `blue_top`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a two-color stack with a capacity of 10\n",
    "stack = TwoColorStack(10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Red stack operations\n",
    "stack.red_push(1)\n",
    "stack.red_push(2)\n",
    "stack.red_push(3)\n",
    "print(\"Red stack peek:\", stack.red_peek())  # Output: 3\n",
    "print(\"Red stack size:\", stack.red_size())  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Blue stack operations\n",
    "stack.blue_push(10)\n",
    "stack.blue_push(20)\n",
    "print(\"Blue stack peek:\", stack.blue_peek())  # Output: 20\n",
    "print(\"Blue stack size:\", stack.blue_size())  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pop from red stack\n",
    "print(\"Popped from red stack:\", stack.red_pop())  # Output: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pop from blue stack\n",
    "print(\"Popped from blue stack:\", stack.blue_pop())  # Output: 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - All operations (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, etc.) run in constant time, i.e., \\(O(1)\\), because each operation only involves modifying or accessing a fixed position in the array.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "  - The space complexity is \\(O(N)\\), where \\(N\\) is the capacity of the underlying array. We are storing both stacks in a single array, so the space used depends on the maximum size of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is efficient and ensures that both stacks can grow and shrink independently without ever overlapping, as long as the combined size does not exceed the capacity of the array."
