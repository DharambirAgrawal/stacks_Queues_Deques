# Stacks, Queues, and Deques

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures: stacks, queues, and double-ended queues (deques). These data structures are essential building blocks in computer science and have various applications in algorithm design and problem-solving.

## Overview

- **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures
- **Queues**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structures
- **Deques**: Double-ended queues that allow insertion and deletion at both ends

## Implementations

This repository includes the following implementations:

1. Array-based Stack
2. Linked List-based Stack
3. Array-based Queue
4. Linked List-based Queue
5. Double-ended Queue (Deque)

## Applications

These data structures are used in various applications including:

- Parsing expressions (stacks)
- Breadth-first search algorithms (queues)
- Job scheduling (queues)
- Sliding window problems (deques)
- Browser history management (stacks)

## Getting Started

To use these implementations, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stacks_Queues_Deques.git
cd stacks_Queues_Deques
```
