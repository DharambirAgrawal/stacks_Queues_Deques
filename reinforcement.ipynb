    "A precise and complete definition of **matching for grouping symbols** in an arithmetic expression can be given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of Matching for Grouping Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "An arithmetic expression has **matching grouping symbols** if every opening symbol (such as `(`, `{`, or `[`) is properly paired with a corresponding closing symbol (such as `)`, `}`, or `]`) such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Every opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol**:\n",
    "   - Each `(` has a matching `)`, each `{` has a matching `}`, and each `[` has a matching `]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The symbols are properly nested**:\n",
    "   - For any pair of opening and closing symbols, if an opening symbol `X` appears before another opening symbol `Y`, then the corresponding closing symbol for `Y` must appear before the closing symbol for `X`. This ensures that symbols are nested in a **last-in, first-out (LIFO)** manner, as in:\n",
    "     - `( [ ] )` is properly nested.\n",
    "     - `( [ ) ]` is not properly nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Structure**:\n",
    "   - An expression with matching grouping symbols can be defined recursively as follows:\n",
    "     - **Base case**: An expression with no grouping symbols has matching grouping symbols (e.g., `5 + 3`).\n",
    "     - **Recursive case**: An expression has matching grouping symbols if it is:\n",
    "       - An expression that consists of an opening symbol followed by an expression with matching grouping symbols, followed by the corresponding closing symbol.\n",
    "       - An expression that consists of two expressions with matching grouping symbols concatenated together.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correct Ordering**:\n",
    "   - Each type of opening symbol must be closed by the correct type of closing symbol in the correct order. For instance:\n",
    "     - `( )`, `{ }`, and `[ ]` are correct pairs.\n",
    "     - A `(` must always be closed by a `)`, never by `}` or `]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Valid expressions**:\n",
    "  - `3 * (2 + 4)`: The `(` and `)` match and are properly nested.\n",
    "  - `{[5 + (3 * 2)] - 7}`: Each `{}`, `[]`, and `()` pair is correctly matched and properly nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invalid expressions**:\n",
    "  - `3 * (2 + 4`: Missing a closing `)`.\n",
    "  - `3 * [2 + (4 - 1]`: Incorrectly nested; the `[` does not close before `)`.\n",

    "2. **Maximum Size**: The queue's size never exceeds 30.\n",
    "3. **Wrapping Around**: The `ArrayQueue` is likely implemented in a circular fashion, meaning that when elements are added, they wrap around to the beginning of the array if there is available space due to prior dequeues.\n",

    "### Key Points in a Circular Array Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "In a circular queue:\n",
    "- `front` keeps track of the index of the first element in the queue.\n",
    "- When elements are dequeued, `front` moves forward (incremented) but wraps around to the beginning of the array when it reaches the end, thanks to modulo operations.\n",
    "- When elements are enqueued, they fill available spaces, potentially wrapping around to the start of the array if there are dequeued spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the queue's size never exceeds 30, this implies:\n",
    "- The array was never resized, so its capacity remained at 30.\n",
    "- The `front` pointer has moved forward with each dequeue operation, wrapping around within the fixed 30-element array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining the Final Value of `front`\n",
    "\n",
    "Without specific enqueue and dequeue operations given, we can only state general behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If the Queue Became Empty**: If all elements were dequeued and the queue became empty, `front` would point to the index where the next element would be enqueued. In most implementations, `front` is reset to `0` when the queue becomes empty.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **If the Queue Still Contains Elements**: If the queue is not empty, `front` would point to the index of the oldest element still in the queue. This index would be determined by how many enqueue and dequeue operations occurred, wrapping around within the array's 30 positions. The exact value would depend on the total count of dequeues, calculated as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{front} = (\\text{initial front} + \\text{number of dequeues}) \\mod 30\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion:\n",
    "- **If empty**: `front` is likely `0`.\n",
    "- **If not empty**: `front` would depend on the total dequeues modulo 30 but would still be between `0` and `29`."
